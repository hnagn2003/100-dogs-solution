# How to generate 100 dogs at distinct locations using diffusion model?

# Introduction

To answer the question “How to generate 100 dogs at distinct locations using diffusion model?”, we need to consider the following aspects:

- Distinct location
    
    The problem of object generation at distinct locations can be considered as a Layout-to-image generation task, where each annotation consists of the top-left point, bottom-right point, and class, corresponding to each coordinate.
    
- Conditional image generation: For the Layout-to-image problem, the current state-of-the-art models all base on the latent diffusion model. ([https://paperswithcode.com/task/layout-to-image-generation](https://paperswithcode.com/task/layout-to-image-generation))
- Quantity: To work with the COCO dataset, the task can be regarded as generating images containing multiple objects (dogs). With 100-dogs generation task, the training and sampling process will be the same with customize datasets

# Dataset

100-dogs generation at distinct locations problem may require specialized datasets. But right now we cannot annotate 100 dogs for each image, so we use COCO dataset. COCO is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset, including data about human, animals, stuffs,… and dogs of courses with its respective bounding box and label.

# Approach
We consider the problem as conditional image generation with conditioning is annotation (bounding boxes and classes), and use Stable Diffusion model for this approach.

Annotation information will be embedded by pretrained CLIP tokenizer and embedding. Then concat it with prompt embedding, then go to U-net by cross-attention mechanism for new image generation with objects in distinct locations.

# Implementation

MY CODE IS A DRAFT. IT MAY WORKED NOT PROPERTY.

I only implement it core pipeline, basicly based on StableDiffusionPipeline of [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main).

About particular training and sampling processes, refer its [docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.26.3/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/text2img#diffusers.StableDiffusionPipeline).
